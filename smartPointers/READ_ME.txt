The program receives three files, a system initialization file, a simulation file to perform the operation,
And a log file used as an output file for errors and printouts on each operation.

The program ran automatically with the simulation file and the boot file and provided printouts in the log file.
The init file is also divided into numbers to make it easier to post.
